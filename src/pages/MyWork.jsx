Admins can add new events, while users can purchase tickets and view their purchased tickets. The application features a main screen displaying an overview of at least five sports, with hyperlinks to event screens. These screens list events sorted by date and time, including details such as the sport name, date, time, venue, disciplines, available seats, and ticket prices. There is a separate page for admins to add events, with strict validation for input. Users can purchase a maximum of 20 tickets per event, with a total limit of 100 tickets. The application uses JPA for database access and Spring Security for authentication. Additionally, unit tests and a REST web service for retrieving events and available seats have been implemented.",

Leveraging the power of React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, VinylCollection offers users a seamless experience in managing and exploring their vinyl records. This platform serves as a testament to my skills in full-stack web development, allowing vinyl enthusiasts to immerse themselves in a vast collection of records while enjoying a user-friendly interface. The website provides an extensive range of albums, each accompanied by comprehensive details. Throughout the development of VinylCollection, I honed my skills in React and Node.js, deepening my understanding of full-stack web development. The project allowed me to practice creating intuitive user interfaces, managing data flow between front-end and back-end components, and developing interactive features that enhance user engagement. This was my very first full-stack web project.",
